Hypotheses
-------------------
 - Financial ratios are good indicators of a business and its operations
 - DBSCAN algorithm will be effective at identifying clusters of differing density, size and shape
 - Points identified as 'noise' can be the basis for further analysis of potentially risky companies

----------

Process
-------------
From paper 2, we note it is important to first separate the data into common domains to ensure we are comparing data points with common characteristics. In this case study on financial ratios, we are dividing our data into industries.

DBCAN can detect clusters of deferring size and shape by locating regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. The algorithm form clusters in the following way:

*“A point **a** is density connected to a point **b** with respect to ϵ and MinPts, if there is a point **c** such that, both **a** and **b** are density reachable from **c** w.r.t. to ϵ and MinPts.”*
